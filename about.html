<a id="Where To Go" class="anchor" href="#Where-To-Go" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where To Go</h4>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Times Square/Rockefeller Center</li>
  <p>Times Square is the hub of NYC, the number one tourist attraction. In other words, it is a must see for any first time tourist making the trip to NYC. Yes, there will be a lot of people no matter when you visit, but it is worth seeing the home of the most famous New Year's Eve Ball Drop in the world. When in Times Square, be sure to check out some of the impressive (and unique) stores such as the the Disney Store, Hershey World, or the Espn Zone. Also be sure to check out a show or two on nearby Broadway, as this is another must when in NYC. You can find ticket booths for purchasing show tickets in and around Times Square and the theaters are scattered about.</p>
  <p>Rockefeller Center is another hub of NYC as it boasts the NYC Christmas Tree during a good chunk of the winter. It is also home to a number of promiment business and NBC's NYC studios. If you travel to NYC during the Winter, Rockerfeller Center is a must, and if you travel during another time then still put it on your list definately check it out if you have some extra time.</p>
  <li>Central Park/Bryant Park</li>
  <p>Central Park and Bryant Park provide a great opportunity to step away from the busy, bustling NYC streets while acually staying right in the middle of NYC. While Central Park is much larger and more well known to tourists, don't count out Bryant Park, a fantastic little oasis in Midtown NYC that turns into a winter wonderland during the winter months and is sometimes known as one of NYC's hidden gems. Regardless of what time of year you visit NYC, make sure to visit either of these two parks if you ever want a break from the busy streets during your visit and forget that you are actually in NYC for a few hours.</p>
  <li>Chelsea</li>
  <p>Chelsea is one of NYC's fantastic neighborhoods. It is nestled on the lower west side, closer to the downtown area of NYC than anyththing else but not quite downtown. The things to note in the Chelsea neighborhood include the highline, Chelsea Market, and Chelsea Piers, however a day could easily be spent just casually walking around this beautiful area of NYC. However, if you are up for more stuctured sight seeing in this area, we can start with the highline, a converted subway track that runs above ground and now provides a pretty, picturesque walk above the strees of the Chelsea. It is definately worth the 45 minute walk down the length of the strip, and at the end of the pathway you can hop off the highline and be right next to some amazing French and Italian restaurants. Next, Chelsea Market, a converted warehouse which boasts some of the best (and cheap) food options in NYC. One could spend hours strolling through this rustic looking building passing shops and restaurants with all types of food. My personal favotite is the donughtery, a fresh which is definately something to check out. Finally, a little farther uptown on the west side highway is Chelsea Piers, a large indoor and outdoor sports facility right on the Hudson River. Feel free to take some swings on the golf range or go bowl a few games while taking advantage of this amazing facility.</p>
  <li>Downtown/City Hall/Tribeca/Battery Park</li>
  <p>As the oldest part of NYC, downtown boasts a generational divide with both extremely modern and rustic aspects of this area of NYC. While downtown, make sure to pay a visit to Battery Park and admire the beautiful boats that sit in the battery park harbor at Manhattan's southern edge. In addition, one of the most magnificent views of the NYC area can be seen from One World Obervatory, a 360 degree observatory at the top of 1 World Trade Center. Finally, make sure to check out one of the cities' most vibrant neighborhoods, TriBeCa, which is home to several world class restuarants including The Palm.</p>
  <li>5th Avenue</li>
  <p>Perhaps the street with the most famous shopping in the world, 5th Avenue presents a strip of high end, very popular department stores that often put on amaizng displays during the holiday period. If you have some money to spend and some time on your hands, 5th Avenue is a must in NYC.</p>

<a id="When To Go" class="anchor" href="#When-To-Go" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When To Go</h4>  
 
<p>Depending on the time of year, NYC offers several types of moods. Therefore, here, in the “When To Go” section, you can find an elaborate breakdown of what NYC is like during different times of the year. Based on your agenda and these breakdowns, you should be able to come to a decision on where you want to start off.</p>
<p>We’ll start off with Winter. Winter is a cheery place in NYC, with the very tall christmas tree lit up in Rockefeller center, the amazing christmas lights display all the way down 5th avenue, and central park, which when covered in snow,  is one of the most spectacular sites in the city. In addition, there’s also my personal favorite, the winter wonderland display at Bryant Park. All in all, the city can help get you away from the dark dreary days of winter, however, if you are a first time tourist and are looking to go see all the sites, do not come in the winter. I would recommend NYC in the winter to those who have been to NYC before and have done their typical sightseeing, and maybe just want to come back for a second time. This is because with all of the winter, holiday-themed displays in NYC, winter is just not the best time to hit up the typical NYC sightseeing stops.</p>
<p>Fall and Spring in NYC are some of the most beautiful parts of the year in NYC. If you happen to be a first time tourist, go during these seasons. More specifically, for the fall I would recommend late September, and for the spring I would recommend early April. These times of year are perfect for sightseeing in that they present ideal conditions in a time period where the city is not flooded by other tourists. By ideal conditions I mean warm enough but not sweltering. The average temperature in September is 75 degrees fahrenheit and the average temperature in April is 61 degrees fahrenheit. Conditions such as these will allow for ideal touring of NYC. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, these are not times of the year when the city has crazy amounts of tourists within its burroughs, meaning you can go to the top of the Empire State Building or visit Madame Tussauds wax museum near Times Square without having to wait 2-3 hours.</p>
<p>The final part of the year we have yet to touch upon is the Spring. NYC in the spring presents an interesting challenge for tourists based on the very high temperatures, usually in the high 80s and/or low to mid 90s, as well as the sheer amount of tourists in the city. If you must visit in the summer, go ahead and do so. You will still have a thrilling experience with memories to last a lifetime. However, if you can, avoid traveling in August. No, NYC does not virtually shut down in August like many European cities, but instead it gets immensely crowded and hot. Subway cars are always packed, no matter the day of week or time of day, and Times Square is virtually at a standstill due to the amount of people. Again, if you must travel in August, go ahead, but make sure to book anything that needs reservations such as restaurants, tours of sites, hotels, and anything else well in advance. Booking in advance helps and is recommended for any time of the year, but is absolutely imperative for the summer.</p>
