<p>Depending on the time of year, NYC offers several types of moods. Therefore, here, in the “When To Go” section, you can find an elaborate breakdown of what NYC is like during different times of the year. Based on your agenda and these breakdowns, you should be able to come to a decision on where you want to start off.</p>
<p>We’ll start off with Winter. Winter is a cheery place in NYC, with the very tall christmas tree lit up in Rockefeller center, the amazing christmas lights display all the way down 5th avenue, and central park, which when covered in snow,  is one of the most spectacular sites in the city. In addition, there’s also my personal favorite, the winter wonderland display at Bryant Park. All in all, the city can help get you away from the dark dreary days of winter, however, if you are a first time tourist and are looking to go see all the sites, do not come in the winter. I would recommend NYC in the winter to those who have been to NYC before and have done their typical sightseeing, and maybe just want to come back for a second time. This is because with all of the winter, holiday-themed displays in NYC, winter is just not the best time to hit up the typical NYC sightseeing stops.</p>
<p>Fall and Spring in NYC are some of the most beautiful parts of the year in NYC. If you happen to be a first time tourist, go during these seasons. More specifically, for the fall I would recommend late September, and for the spring I would recommend early April. These times of year are perfect for sightseeing in that they present ideal conditions in a time period where the city is not flooded by other tourists. By ideal conditions I mean warm enough but not sweltering. The average temperature in September is 75 degrees fahrenheit and the average temperature in April is 61 degrees fahrenheit. Conditions such as these will allow for ideal touring of NYC. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, these are not times of the year when the city has crazy amounts of tourists within its burroughs, meaning you can go to the top of the Empire State Building or visit Madame Tussauds wax museum near Times Square without having to wait 2-3 hours.</p>
<p>The final part of the year we have yet to touch upon is the Spring. NYC in the spring presents an interesting challenge for tourists based on the very high temperatures, usually in the high 80s and/or low to mid 90s, as well as the sheer amount of tourists in the city. If you must visit in the summer, go ahead and do so. You will still have a thrilling experience with memories to last a lifetime. However, if you can, avoid traveling in August. No, NYC does not virtually shut down in August like many European cities, but instead it gets immensely crowded and hot. Subway cars are always packed, no matter the day of week or time of day, and Times Square is virtually at a standstill due to the amount of people. Again, if you must travel in August, go ahead, but make sure to book anything that needs reservations such as restaurants, tours of sites, hotels, and anything else well in advance. Booking in advance helps and is recommended for any time of the year, but is absolutely imperative for the summer.</p>
