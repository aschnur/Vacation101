<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Tony Di Napoli</li>
  <p>A famous family style NYC Italian Restaurant with 2 NYC locations, one on the upper east side and one in Times Square.</p>
  <li>Smith and Wollensky's</li>
  <p>A world-remowed steakhouse offering a world class steak dinner. The seafood platter appetizer is known for being the best in NYC and the Profiteroles are the key recommended dish for desert.</p>
  <li>Gotham Bar and Grill</li>
  <p>"The ideal spot for any occasion, Gotham Bar and Grill serves dinner seven nights a week, and serves lunch Monday through Friday, when the room is awash in bright sunlight, and the restaurant offers its legendary prix fixe lunch menu, an institution unto itself and one of New York City’s great values."</p>
  <li>Peter Lugar Steak House</li>
  <p>A restaurant with a whole lot of hisroy, Peter Lugar's is quite possibly the most famous steak house in the world, and most definately is in NYC. If you want to celebrate, this is the perfect place to go, however as with all the other places on this list, Peter Lugar's is very pricey.</p>
  <li>Nobu New York</li>
  <p>The first uptown New York location by legendary chef Nobu Matsuhisa, opened to much anticipation in the summer of 2005. Nobu's co-owners are his longtime partners: renowned restaurateur Drew Nieporent, Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro, and producer Meir Teper. The restaurant showcases Nobu's signature new style Japanese cuisine with classic dishes such as Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño and Black Cod Miso and new creations such as the hibachi table.</p>

<a id="When To Go" class="anchor" href="#When-To-Go" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When To Go</h4>  
 
<p>Depending on the time of year, NYC offers several types of moods. Therefore, here, in the “When To Go” section, you can find an elaborate breakdown of what NYC is like during different times of the year. Based on your agenda and these breakdowns, you should be able to come to a decision on where you want to start off.</p>
<p>We’ll start off with Winter. Winter is a cheery place in NYC, with the very tall christmas tree lit up in Rockefeller center, the amazing christmas lights display all the way down 5th avenue, and central park, which when covered in snow,  is one of the most spectacular sites in the city. In addition, there’s also my personal favorite, the winter wonderland display at Bryant Park. All in all, the city can help get you away from the dark dreary days of winter, however, if you are a first time tourist and are looking to go see all the sites, do not come in the winter. I would recommend NYC in the winter to those who have been to NYC before and have done their typical sightseeing, and maybe just want to come back for a second time. This is because with all of the winter, holiday-themed displays in NYC, winter is just not the best time to hit up the typical NYC sightseeing stops.</p>
<p>Fall and Spring in NYC are some of the most beautiful parts of the year in NYC. If you happen to be a first time tourist, go during these seasons. More specifically, for the fall I would recommend late September, and for the spring I would recommend early April. These times of year are perfect for sightseeing in that they present ideal conditions in a time period where the city is not flooded by other tourists. By ideal conditions I mean warm enough but not sweltering. The average temperature in September is 75 degrees fahrenheit and the average temperature in April is 61 degrees fahrenheit. Conditions such as these will allow for ideal touring of NYC. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, these are not times of the year when the city has crazy amounts of tourists within its burroughs, meaning you can go to the top of the Empire State Building or visit Madame Tussauds wax museum near Times Square without having to wait 2-3 hours.</p>
<p>The final part of the year we have yet to touch upon is the Spring. NYC in the spring presents an interesting challenge for tourists based on the very high temperatures, usually in the high 80s and/or low to mid 90s, as well as the sheer amount of tourists in the city. If you must visit in the summer, go ahead and do so. You will still have a thrilling experience with memories to last a lifetime. However, if you can, avoid traveling in August. No, NYC does not virtually shut down in August like many European cities, but instead it gets immensely crowded and hot. Subway cars are always packed, no matter the day of week or time of day, and Times Square is virtually at a standstill due to the amount of people. Again, if you must travel in August, go ahead, but make sure to book anything that needs reservations such as restaurants, tours of sites, hotels, and anything else well in advance. Booking in advance helps and is recommended for any time of the year, but is absolutely imperative for the summer.</p>
