 <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Times Square/Rockefeller Center</li>
   <p>Times Square is the hub of NYC, the number one tourist attraction. In other words, it is a must see for any first time tourist making the trip to NYC. Yes, there will be a lot of people no matter when you visit, but it is worth seeing the home of the most famous New Year's Eve Ball Drop in the world. When in Times Square, be sure to check out some of the impressive (and unique) stores such as the the Disney Store, Hershey World, or the Espn Zone. Also be sure to check out a show or two on nearby Broadway, as this is another must when in NYC. You can find ticket booths for purchasing show tickets in and around Times Square and the theaters are scattered about.</p>

   <p>Rockefeller Center is another hub of NYC as it boasts the NYC Christmas Tree during a good chunk of the winter. It is also home to a number of promiment business and NBC's NYC studios. If you travel to NYC during the Winter, Rockerfeller Center is a must, and if you travel during another time then still put it on your list definately check it out if you have some extra time.</p>
 <li>Central Park/Bryant Park</li>
   <p>Central Park and Bryant Park provide a great opportunity to step away from the busy, bustling NYC streets while acually staying right in the middle of NYC. While Central Park is much larger and more well known to tourists, don't count out Bryant Park, a fantastic little oasis in Midtown NYC that turns into a winter wonderland during the winter months and is sometimes known as one of NYC's hidden gems. Regardless of what time of year you visit NYC, make sure to visit either of these two parks if you ever want a break from the busy streets during your visit and forget that you are actually in NYC for a few hours.</p>  
   <li>Chelsea</li>
   <p>Chelsea is one of NYC's fantastic neighborhoods. It is nestled on the lower west side, closer to the downtown area of NYC than anyththing else but not quite downtown. The things to note in the Chelsea neighborhood include the highline, Chelsea Market, and Chelsea Piers, however a day could easily be spent just casually walking around this beautiful area of NYC. However, if you are up for more stuctured sight seeing in this area, we can start with the highline, a converted subway track that runs above ground and now provides a pretty, picturesque walk above the strees of the Chelsea. It is definately worth the 45 minute walk down the length of the strip, and at the end of the pathway you can hop off the highline and be right next to some amazing French and Italian restaurants. Next, Chelsea Market, a converted warehouse which boasts some of the best (and cheap) food options in NYC. One could spend hours strolling through this rustic looking building passing shops and restaurants with all types of food. My personal favotite is the donughtery, a fresh which is definately something to check out. Finally, a little farther uptown on the west side highway is Chelsea Piers, a large indoor and outdoor sports facility right on the Hudson River. Feel free to take some swings on the golf range or go bowl a few games while taking advantage of this amazing facility.</p>

  <li>Downtown/City Hall/Tribeca/Battery Park</li>
   <p>As the oldest part of NYC, downtown boasts a generational divide with both extremely modern and rustic aspects of this area of NYC. While downtown, make sure to pay a visit to Battery Park and admire the beautiful boats that sit in the battery park harbor at Manhattan's southern edge. In addition, one of the most magnificent views of the NYC area can be seen from One World Obervatory, a 360 degree observatory at the top of 1 World Trade Center. Finally, make sure to check out one of the cities' most vibrant neighborhoods, TriBeCa, which is home to several world class restuarants including The Palm.</p>
 <li>5th Avenue</li>
   <p>Perhaps the street with the most famous shopping in the world, 5th Avenue presents a strip of high end, very popular department stores that often put on amaizng displays during the holiday period. If you have some money to spend and some time on your hands, 5th Avenue is a must in NYC.</p>
   <p>Some other things to do/see in and around NYC that may not be as well known or as notable as the activities/places listed above but are still worth trying out are as follows: </p>
  <li>Ellis Island</li>
  <li>Radio City Music Hall</li>
