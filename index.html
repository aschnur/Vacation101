<a id="Where To Go" class="anchor" href="#Where-To-Go" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where To Go</h4>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Times Square/Rockefeller Center</li>
  <p>Times Square is the hub of NYC, the number one tourist attraction. In other words, it is a must see for any first time tourist making the trip to NYC. Yes, there will be a lot of people there, but it is worth seeing the place with the most famous New Year's Eve Ball Drop in the world. When in Times Square be sure to check out some of the big stores such as the the Disney Store or Hershey World. Also be sure to check out a show or two on Broadway as this is another must when in NYC. You can find ticket booths for purchasing show tickets in and around Times Square and the theaters are scattered about.</p>
  <p>Rockefeller Center is another hub of NYC as it boasts the NYC Christmas Tree during a good chunk of the winter. It is also home to a number of promiment business and NBC's NYC studios. If you trave to NYC dueing the Winter Rockerfeller Center is a must, if during another time then put it on your list, and if you have some extra time, definately check it out.</p>
  <li>Central Park/Bryant Park</li>
  <p>Central Park and Bryant Park provide a great opportunity to get step away from the busy, bustling NYC streets while acually staying in NYC. While Central Park is much larger and is one of the key things people think of when they think of NYC, don't count out Bryant Park, a fantastic little oasis in Midtown NYC that tuens into a winter wonderland during the winter months. Regardless of what time of year you visit NYC, make sure to visit either of these two famous parks in order to forget that you are actually in NYC for a few hours.</p>
  <li>Chelsea</li>
  <p>Chelsea is a fantastic area of NYC, closer to downtown than uptown but not quite downtown yet. The things to note in the Chelsea are the highline, Chelsea Market, and Chelsea Piers. Thr highline is a converted subway track that runs above ground and now provides a pretty, pictureque walk above the strees of the Chelsea. It is definately worth the 45 minute walk down the length of the strip, and at the end of the pathway you can hop off the highline and be right next to some amazing French and Italian restaurants. Chelsea Market, a converted warehouse, boasts some of the best (and cheap) food options in NYC. One could spend hours strolling through this rustic looking building passing shops and restaurants with all types of food. My personal favotite is the donughtery, which is definately something to check out. Finally, a little farther uptown on the west side highway is Chelsea Piers, a large indoor and outdoor sports facility right on the Hudson River. Feel free to take some swings on the golf range or go bowl a few games while taking advantage of this amazing facility.</p>

<a id="When To Go" class="anchor" href="#When-To-Go" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When To Go</h4>  
 
<p>Depending on the time of year, NYC offers several types of moods. Therefore, here, in the “When To Go” section, you can find an elaborate breakdown of what NYC is like during different times of the year. Based on your agenda and these breakdowns, you should be able to come to a decision on where you want to start off.</p>
<p>We’ll start off with Winter. Winter is a cheery place in NYC, with the very tall christmas tree lit up in Rockefeller center, the amazing christmas lights display all the way down 5th avenue, and central park, which when covered in snow,  is one of the most spectacular sites in the city. In addition, there’s also my personal favorite, the winter wonderland display at Bryant Park. All in all, the city can help get you away from the dark dreary days of winter, however, if you are a first time tourist and are looking to go see all the sites, do not come in the winter. I would recommend NYC in the winter to those who have been to NYC before and have done their typical sightseeing, and maybe just want to come back for a second time. This is because with all of the winter, holiday-themed displays in NYC, winter is just not the best time to hit up the typical NYC sightseeing stops.</p>
<p>Fall and Spring in NYC are some of the most beautiful parts of the year in NYC. If you happen to be a first time tourist, go during these seasons. More specifically, for the fall I would recommend late September, and for the spring I would recommend early April. These times of year are perfect for sightseeing in that they present ideal conditions in a time period where the city is not flooded by other tourists. By ideal conditions I mean warm enough but not sweltering. The average temperature in September is 75 degrees fahrenheit and the average temperature in April is 61 degrees fahrenheit. Conditions such as these will allow for ideal touring of NYC. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, these are not times of the year when the city has crazy amounts of tourists within its burroughs, meaning you can go to the top of the Empire State Building or visit Madame Tussauds wax museum near Times Square without having to wait 2-3 hours.</p>
<p>The final part of the year we have yet to touch upon is the Spring. NYC in the spring presents an interesting challenge for tourists based on the very high temperatures, usually in the high 80s and/or low to mid 90s, as well as the sheer amount of tourists in the city. If you must visit in the summer, go ahead and do so. You will still have a thrilling experience with memories to last a lifetime. However, if you can, avoid traveling in August. No, NYC does not virtually shut down in August like many European cities, but instead it gets immensely crowded and hot. Subway cars are always packed, no matter the day of week or time of day, and Times Square is virtually at a standstill due to the amount of people. Again, if you must travel in August, go ahead, but make sure to book anything that needs reservations such as restaurants, tours of sites, hotels, and anything else well in advance. Booking in advance helps and is recommended for any time of the year, but is absolutely imperative for the summer.</p>
